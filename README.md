# STLenographer
Watermark STL files using stenography

This program hides watermark information within the STL files geometry. It is capable of hiding the fact by applying AES encryption to the data (i.e. without a password/key the information can't be retrieved).

The watermark should protect against simple reuploads. However I have not done any checks on how resilient this method is to changes.

Because of this the format might change in the future so it is recommended to save the exact version of the program, in order to be able to read the watermark at a later point.
